UPDATE & install prerequisites

$ apt-get update

$ apt-get install -y gcc g++ wget git cmake pkg-config protobuf-compiler libprotobuf-dev libssl-dev

 

BUILD BOOST

$ wget https://boostorg.jfrog.io/artifactory/main/release/1.76.0/source/boost_1_76_0_rc2.tar.gz

$ tar -xzf boost_1_70_0.tar.gz

$ cd boost_1_70_0

$ ./bootstrap.sh

$ ./b2 headers

$ ./b2 -j <Num Parallel>

 

<Num Parallel> is the number of threads to compile; you set it depending on hardware; if it crashes, just lower it

 

GET Rippled

$ git clone git@github.com:ripple/rippled.git

$ cd rippled

$ git checkout release (or master or develop)

 

CONFIGURE BOOST PATH

$ export BOOST_ROOT=~/boost_1_70_0

Alternatively, you can add DBOOST_ROOT=~/boost_1_70_0 to the command line when invoking cmake below

 

GENERATE CONFIG, COMPILE, INSTALL

mkdir my_build

cd my_build

cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/local ..

cmake --build . --target install -- -j <parallel jobs>

 

The command "-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/local" sets the path where to install the ripple exe and the config files

 

CONFIG

 

Info is below, but when you reach this step you can just let me know and I can give you the files with settings and keys already set up.

 

    After building this way, the exe to build validator keys and tokens is not created, though.

So these keys must be generated on another machine with a regular rippled installed from packages, then copied to local machine afterwards.

The version of rippled package used for key generation doesn’t matter.

Info on this step can be found here: https://xrpl.org/run-rippled-as-a-validator.html, step 3: Enable validation on your rippled server

 

    After rippled is compiled, the ripple.cfg file and validators.txt need to be edited – to create the settings for our private network

The 2 files should be located at =/opt/local/etc/…, with the rippled exe at =/opt/local/bin/…

The info on how to set up rippled.cfg and validators.txt is too complex, we need to talk for this. At least this time, I will just give you the 2 files.

 

 

START

$ cd /opt/local/bin/

$ sudo ./rippled –conf /opt/ripple/etc/rippled.cfg –quorum 2

 

This will start the process in foreground

 

Useful commands:

 

$ cd /opt/local/bin/

$ sudo ./rippled –conf /opt/ripple/etc/rippled.cfg peers (list current peers)

$ sudo ./rippled –conf /opt/ripple/etc/rippled.cfg server_info (show server state)

$ sudo ./rippled –conf /opt/ripple/etc/rippled.cfg account_info rHb9CJAWyB4rj91VRWn96DkukG4bwdtyTh (show genesis account balance)
